INTRODUCTION
This is a small fishing simulation program and my very first personnal project as developer. I had the idea while working on classes and OOP course during my coding boot camp (Coding Academy EPITECH France).
It's quite simple, you run the program and see what you can catch !

"V1" folder contains the first version, with the fishes separatedin 3 categories and files. All fishes have the same chance to be caught, and there is currently no bait mechanics.

Fish weights are scaled with their known average, and maximum is 10 grams under record.

All data comes from https://www.farnhamanglingsociety.com/species/

HOW TO FISH
1. Clone this repository on your computer.
2. On your computer, open a terminal and go to the cloned repository
3. Run the program using the command ``` php gone_fishing.php ```
