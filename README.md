# Gone Fishing ðŸŽ£ ! 

Updated at : 06 / 15 / 2023

## Introduction
This is a small fishing simulation program and my very first personnal project as developer. I had the idea while working on PHP Classes and OOP course during my coding boot camp (Coding Academy EPITECH France).
It's quite simple, you run the program and see what you can catch !

"V1" folder contains the first version, with the fishes separated in 3 categories and files. All fishes have the same chance to be caught, and there is currently no bait mechanics and records.

Fish weights are scaled with their known average, and maximum is 10 grams under record.

All data comes from [Farnham Angling Society](https://www.farnhamanglingsociety.com/species/)

## How to fish
1. Clone this repository on your computer.
2. On your computer, open a terminal and go to the cloned repository and V1 folder.
3. Run the program using the command ``` php gone_fishing.php ```
4. The result should look like this :
